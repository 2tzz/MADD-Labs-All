Exercise 06: Swift Fundamentals Demonstration

This repository contains a single Swift file (main.swift) designed to illustrate the foundational control flow and data structure concepts required in Swift programming.

The program combines several language features into a single, runnable script, making it an excellent reference for how these core elements interact.

🚀 Concepts Demonstrated

The main.swift file provides working examples for the following Swift features:

Data Structures

Array: Demonstrating an ordered collection of integers.

Dictionary: Storing key-value pairs (student names and scores).

Set: Managing an unordered collection of unique values (IDs).

Control Flow

if/else if/else: Standard conditional execution based on a student score.

switch: Advanced pattern matching using score ranges.

Ranges (... and ..<): Used within the switch statement and for-in loop to define inclusive and half-open sequences.

Iteration

while loop: Demonstrating pre-condition checking for array iteration.

repeat-while loop: Showing a loop that executes its body at least once (for a countdown).

for-in loop: Used with a closed range for simple counting.

Safety & Optionality

Optionals (?): Declaring variables that may contain nil.

Optional Binding (if let): Safely unwrapping an optional value before use.

Nil Coalescing Operator (??): Providing a default value when an optional is nil.

💡 How to Run the Code

This code is written in plain Swift and does not require an advanced project setup.

Option 1: Swift Playground (Recommended)

Create a new file in a Swift Playground on macOS or iPadOS.

Copy the entire content of main.swift into the Playground file.

The output will automatically appear in the console sidebar as the code executes.

Option 2: Replit or Online Environment

Create a new Swift project on Replit or a similar online Swift compiler.

Copy the content of main.swift into the editor.

Run the project to see the output printed to the terminal.

Option 3: Local Command Line

Save the file as main.swift.

Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.

Execute the code using the Swift command-line tool:

swift main.swift
